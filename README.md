## Hello world! 👋  
### I'm Kyrylo - Gameplay Developer based in Warsaw, Poland.

🎮 I focus on gameplay mechanics, systems, and prototyping using **Unity**.

Currently working on my solo hobby project **[Bore](https://github.com/Kra1ker/Bore)** - a local co-op 2D platformer with a dynamic free-angle splitscreen system.

I enjoy experimenting with ideas, breaking them into milestones, and turning concepts into working gameplay.

Most of my repositories are small-to-mid scale projects created to explore specific mechanics, tools, or workflows.

**Tech & tools:**
- Unity (main engine)
- C#
- Basic experience with Unreal Engine
- Miro for design, planning, and system breakdowns

I’ve built around **10–15 project repositories**, some of them are private.

📫 Contacts are available on my profile — feel free to reach out.
